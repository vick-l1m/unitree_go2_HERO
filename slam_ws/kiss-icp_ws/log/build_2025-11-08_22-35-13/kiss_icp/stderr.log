[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at /home/victor-22/go2_ws/slam_ws/kiss-icp_ws/kiss-icp/cpp/kiss_icp/3rdparty/find_dependencies.cmake:25 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0135 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
